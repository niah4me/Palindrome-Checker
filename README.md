# Palindrome-Checker
A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same backward as forward. Examples include "racecar", "madam", and even phrases like "nurses run" when you ignore the spaces.   Your job is to write a program that can figure out if a given word is a palindrome. This means it should look the same whether you read it from the start or the end.
